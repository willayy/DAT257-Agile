# DAT257-Agile
Agile project in DAT257

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started
Note that the following commands are to be run in the agile-app directory, not DAT257-Agile.

If the package-lock.json was recently updated, or you have not run the project in a long time please run:

```bash
npm install
```

Otherwise / afterwards, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
